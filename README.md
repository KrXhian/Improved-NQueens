# Improved-NQueens
Java based venerable N-Queens Algorithm (Improved) 

The algorithm is based on the classic venerable 8 queens solution.
The program utilizes the unique diagonal properties of matrices to traverse the array in such a way that it won't check every cell of the matrix.

A matrix diagonal have unique properties that can be traversed by utilizing an array, we then exploit this traverse function to speed up the solving of the matrices.
More explanation to the algorithm function is in the paper provided.
